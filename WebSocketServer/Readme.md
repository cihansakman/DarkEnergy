# WebSocketServer Integration

The WebSocket server ensures communication between the Chrome Extension and Python API, facilitating the transfer of sub-processes running on the Chrome Extension to provide detailed information about the running processes to the user.

## Run

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

2. Start the WebSocket server with the following command:

```
node index.js
```
